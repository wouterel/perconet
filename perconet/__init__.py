"""
Perconet is a package for analyzing the percolation properties of periodic
nets.

Simple examples of periodic nets are a cubic lattice in three dimensions with
periodic boundary conditions, or a honeycomb lattice in two dimensions with
periodic boundary conditions.

In physical systems, the nodes (points) in the network will typically have
a position associated with them, and the bonds (edges) can be defined to
connect two nodes. The effect of periodic boundaries is captured by associating
a boundary-crossing vector with each edge.

Mathematically speaking, any graph that is embedded in a 3-torus can be
analyzed with this package. It is not necessary to a associate positions with
the nodes, as long as the boundary-crossing properties of the edges are
prescribed correctly.
